# Watasha's Analysis:

Charter schools have more students passing overall and are getting it done with $44 less per student on average than district schools. 
Albeit, Charter schools have 45% less students than district schools. 
The top performing schools are all charter schools while the bottom performing schools are all district schools.

Larger schools rank lower in all score categories as shown in the Scores by School Size table probably due to higher teacher/student ratios.

There's an inverse trend when comparing spending per student to pass rates. As the price of spending increases, the scores are decreasing as shown in the Scores by School Spending table.
